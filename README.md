## Linked List Sorting Program
This program reads a list of integers from scanned user input and saves them in a linked list in ascending order.

## Stack Sorting Program
This program updates the linked list sorting program to store scanned user input in a stack of ascending order.

## How to compile, run, and create the documentation for each program: 

1. To compile the program navigate to the `src` folder using `cd src`, then use the command `javac *.java`.

2. To run the program use the command `java Main.java`.

3. To create documentation files use the command `javadoc -d docs *.java`.

This procedure will need to be followed separately for each program.
